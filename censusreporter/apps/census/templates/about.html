            <p>Census Reporter is an independent project to make data from the American Community Survey easier to use. We are unaffiliated with the U.S. Census Bureau. </p>
            <p>
                A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207075007/http://www.knightfoundation.org/press-room/press-release/six-ventures-bring-data-public-winners-knight-news/">News Challenge grant from the <strong>Knight Foundation</strong></a> funded the initial build-out of the site. <strong>Joe Germuska</strong>                developed the grant proposal and is the project lead. Our original project advisory board consisted of <strong>Joe Germuska</strong>, <strong>John Keefe</strong>, and <strong>Ryan Pitts</strong>. We are grateful to <a href="https://ire.org"><strong>Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE)</strong></a>,
                who served as the fiscal agent for our original grant funds. After the original grant was spent, we incorporated as Census Reporter, NFP, an Illinois not-for-profit corporation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Sara Schnadt</strong> served as the original designer and community coordinator. <strong>Ryan Pitts</strong> and <strong>Ian Dees</strong> were the primary software development team. <strong>Joe Germuska</strong> served as project
                manager and wrangler, and, with <strong>John Keefe</strong>, contributed to project design and planning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the development of the initial site, additional contributions of code and/or documentation have been made by
                <strong>Avriana Allen</strong>,
                <strong>Durell Gill</strong>,
                <strong>Cathy He</strong>,
                <strong>Kristen Li</strong>,
                <strong>Joon Park</strong>,
                <strong>Tushar Samant</strong>, and
                <strong>Sumin Woo</strong>. <strong>Ian Dees</strong> has donated a substantial amount of his time each year to update Census Reporter with new <abbr title="American Community Survey">ACS</abbr> releases.
