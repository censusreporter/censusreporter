    Each stat on the profile page can have nation-, state- and county-level
    values, indexed to 100 for comparisons (that is, expressed as a percentage
    of that statistic's value for the profile geography). That index value can
    be passed into this template filter to generate a comparative phrase.

    The COMPARISON_PHRASE_MAP defines the comparative phrases; the dict keys
    are the lower boundary of the range of values that result in that phrase.
    
    For example, the effective range of index values that return the phrase
    "about half" would be 45 to 55.
